# 🤖 AI-Powered LinkedIn + Twitter Posting Agent (n8n Workflow)

This repository contains an **automation workflow built in n8n** during my internship period at company.  
The agent helps automate company content publishing by generating **SEO-friendly LinkedIn posts** and **tweet-sized content for Twitter (X)** directly from Google Sheets, saving hours of manual work.  

---

## 🚀 Features
This workflow (`post for linkedin and twitter.json`) includes:
1. **Google Sheets Integration** – Reads post ideas directly from a sheet.  
2. **AI Expansion** – Uses an LLM to create professional, SEO-optimized LinkedIn posts (1,200–2,800 chars).  
3. **Twitter Optimization** – Automatically trims posts into 280-character tweets.  
4. **Dual Publishing** – Posts simultaneously to **LinkedIn** and **Twitter (X)**.  
5. **Human-Like Scheduling** – Adds random wait times (according to user requirement) between actions to mimic natural posting.  
6. **Batch Processing** – Handles multiple rows of ideas in one run.  
7. **Merge & Tracking** – Keeps posts synced across both platforms.  

✅ **Impact**: This automation reduces manual effort, maintains consistency in branding, and optimizes for **reach, SEO, and engagement**.
